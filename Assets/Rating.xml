Under the initial system, a learner's rating was equivalent to their rapid rating â€” for example, a learner with a rapid rating of 1500 would have a tracked rating of 1500, and any changes in this rating over time directly reflected changes in their rapid performance. In the revised system, the rating is now calculated as the average of the learner's rapid, blitz, bullet, and puzzle ratings. For instance, if a learner has a rapid rating of 1500 and a blitz rating of 1300, their current tracked rating would be 1400. This composite rating, calculated as the arithmetic mean of the four. will now be used to monitor progress on a monthly basis.
